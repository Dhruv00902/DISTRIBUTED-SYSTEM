In a distributed system, multiple computers or processes need to coordinate access to shared resources to prevent data corruption or inconsistencies. Mutual exclusion ensures that only one process can be in a critical section (a code block that modifies shared resources) at a time.

Token Ring Algorithm

The token ring algorithm is a simple and effective solution for mutual exclusion. Here's how it works:

Logical Ring: Imagine the processes arranged in a logical ring. Each process knows its position and the neighbor to its right (next in the ring).
Unique Token: A special token circulates around the ring continuously.
Entering Critical Section: A process can only enter the critical section if it has the token.
Passing the Token: Once a process finishes its critical section, it forwards the token to its neighbor.
This guarantees that at most one process can hold the token at a time, ensuring mutual exclusion.

Explanation of the Code (ring_token.c):

Header Inclusions:

stdio.h for standard input/output functions (e.g., printf)
conio.h (may not be necessary or portable; consider getch alternatives)
dos.h (likely not needed for modern systems; time functions are usually in time.h)
<time.h> for time measurement (time)
Variables:

cs (critical section): A flag indicating if a process is in the critical section (0 = not in, 1 = in)
pro (process number): Keeps track of the current process number
run (time limit): Defines a maximum time a process can stay in the critical section (adjustable)
key (user input): Stores the key pressed by the user
t1, t2 (time variables): Used for timing the process's critical section duration
Main Function:

Initialization:

Prints a message asking the user to press a key (except 'q') to enter a process.
Prints instructions to press 'q' to exit.
Initializes t1 with the current time minus 5 seconds (likely not relevant to the algorithm).
Loop (until 'q' is pressed):

Waiting Loop:

This loop waits for the user to press a key using kbhit.
If cs is non-zero (a process is in the critical section) and the time exceeds the run limit, it prints a message indicating the process exiting the critical section and sets cs back to 0.
Key Handling:

Reads the pressed key using getch.
If the key is not 'q':
If cs is non-zero (another process is in the critical section):
Prints an error message indicating another process is already using the critical section.
Otherwise (cs is zero):
Prints a message indicating the current process entering the critical section.
Increments pro to keep track of the process number.
Sets cs to 1 to mark the critical section as occupied.
Updates t1 with the current time to start timing the critical section duration.
Output:

The output will depend on the user's input and the run time limit. It will show messages like:

"Press a key(except q) to enter a process into critical section."
"Process %d entered critical section" when a process enters.
"Process %d exits critical section" when a process exits (if it reached the time limit).
"Error: Another process is currently executing critical section. Please wait till its execution is over" if a process tries to enter while another is already in

This is a simplified simulation, not a real distributed system where processes communicate directly.
The code uses some outdated libraries (conio.h, dos.h). Modern systems might use different ones.

1. What is mutual exclusion in distributed systems?

Explanation: Mutual exclusion ensures that only one process can access a shared resource (critical section) at a time, preventing data corruption or inconsistencies.
2. Explain the concept of the token ring algorithm for mutual exclusion.

Explanation: Imagine processes arranged in a logical ring. A unique token circulates continuously. A process can enter the critical section only if it has the token. Once finished, it passes the token to its neighbor.
3. Briefly describe the functionality of the provided code (ring_token.c).

Explanation: This code simulates the token ring algorithm conceptually. It doesn't involve actual token passing between processes. It tracks a critical section flag (cs) and process number (pro) to simulate turn-taking. Users press keys to enter/exit the critical section (simulating token possession).
4. What is the purpose of the run variable in the code?

Explanation: run defines a maximum time a process can stay in the critical section. This helps prevent a process from holding the "token" indefinitely.
5. How would you improve the code for a more realistic simulation?

Explanation: You could modify the code to involve communication between processes (simulating token passing) instead of user input. Consider using libraries for network communication.
6. What are some limitations of the token ring algorithm?

Explanation: The token ring can experience delays as the token travels around the ring. A process might have to wait a long time even if no one is using the critical section.
7. Can you suggest alternative algorithms for mutual exclusion?

Explanation: Some alternatives include semaphore-based algorithms, centralized server algorithms (like Lamport's Bakery algorithm), or optimistic concurrency control. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages.
